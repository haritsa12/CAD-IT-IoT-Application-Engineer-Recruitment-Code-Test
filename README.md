No.3

Problem Definition: Generate random value of humidity and temperature for every 2 seconds. The user can Start and Stop. Humidity and temperature data are grouped by date and room.Outputs of the endpoint should be: min, max, median, and avg from sensors’ values.(temperature, humidity). We have to make live graphs of every data(min,max,median,average)

Output: Datas are stored in output_3.json file and also there is live graph for these datas. We can see in json file that the data is stored every 2 seconds (look at 'timestamp' object.
